# E-Reader
The now not so poorly programmed E-Reader with a few fixesa and tweaks.

As this application is fairly usable now i will probably not release another version or update the current one.

As always you are free to use any of the code or even the whole programm in a projeckt.

Here a link to the old repo as most of the documentation is there, for now: https://github.com/FlorianxJ/Poorly-programmed-jpg-viewer/releases/tag/Reader

I might add a wiki in the future.
